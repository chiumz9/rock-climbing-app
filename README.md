# Peak Scout


A [website](https://earnest-profiterole-786338.netlify.app/) designed to help rock climbers find their next place to go rock climbing. Users can filter by name, city, and if the facility offers top rope or auto-belay systems. We're pulling information from an API [Rock-Climbing-Gyms-API](https://rock-climbing-api.herokuapp.com/api/gyms)

## Full CRUD

Users may edit, delete, and add gyms(maybe)

## Authentication

Using JSON Web Token (JWT) users are allowed to securely sign in. As of now Sign in only greets the user in the future we hope to make it so users can add and edit gyms and only admins can delete gyms.
